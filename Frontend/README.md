# Wikipedle

## Rules
1. You will be given a random article, the goal is to guess the title.
2. Distance will be given as a count of the number of links the two articles share, the higher this number the better
3. More and more text will be shown to you as you make more guesses
4. If you guess incorrectly 5 times, the game is over!
